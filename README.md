# Pseudo-code lab

For this lab, we will not do any coding. We will just learn how to solve problems and make diagrams. You will use Canva or paper and pencil for these assignments.

### Setup

For each day you will create a new Canva Page (total of 4) and work on a new problem.

On the last day (Saturday), choose one canva page to convert into a webpage. Take the content of your Canva page and write it up in HTML. You may use CSS as a bonus.

### Instructions

Go to this repository to see detailed instructions for each day.

### Turn in

You will turn in 4 canva pages--one for each day. You may submit the public link to the Canva page, or you may export the Canva page as an image.

Be sure to double check your link in an incognito browser to make sure it is a public link that can be viewed by the grader. Also be sure to label each link or image you submit so that the grader knows which goes with which day.

Day 5 will be an HTML page. You may submit this as a GitHub Repo, a Replit, or upload as a zip file. (Be sure to reduce the size of your diagram image so it fits.)
